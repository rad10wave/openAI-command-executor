# OpenAI Command Executor
Remembering all the command-line queries for various applications like Git, Node.js, npm, Python, and others can be a difficult task. This is where the "OpenAI Command Executor" comes into play.

"OpenAI Command Executor" is a command-line application that leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT-3 model to understand and respond to user queries. Instead of having to remember and type in complex command-line queries, users simply describe what they want to do in natural language. The application then interacts with the OpenAI API to generate a command-line query that matches the user's intent.

Upon running the application, the user is prompted to enter a command-line query. This query is then sent to the OpenAI API, which generates a response. The user is then asked if they want to execute the command-line code based on the response from the OpenAI API.

If the user chooses to execute the code, the application runs the command and displays the output. If the user chooses to retry, they are prompted to enter a new query.

This project showcases the potential of AI in automating and simplifying command-line tasks. It can be a useful tool for developers who frequently use the command line for their tasks. The project is open-source and contributions are welcome.
